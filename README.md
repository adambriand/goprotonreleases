# goprotonreleases

A simple app written in Go to display the latest Proton releases (Valve Software compatibility tool for Linux).

This app checks the repositories for Proton and Proton-ge-custom (GloriousEggroll) and displays their current versions, release dates, and download links to stdout.

## Build and Installation

To build, download the source code and build using Go (`go build goprotonreleases.go`).

To download and run the Linux binary, get the latest .tar.gz from Releases, uncompress, and run.

## Configuration

This is a MVP for a simple check of Proton versions, there are no configuration options currently.
