# goprotonreleases
A simple app written in Go to display Proton releases.

This app checks the repositories for Proton and Proton-ge-custom (GloriousEggroll) and displays their current versions and latest release dates.

## installation

For installing from source, download the source code and build using Go.

For Linux binary release, download the latest version from Releases.

## configuration and running the program

This is a MVP for a simple check of Proton versions, there are no custom configurations currently. Just run goprotonreleases and the results will be in STDOUT.
